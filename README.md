We can see the Shortest Job First scheduler led to a significantly lower average waiting time while the average turnaround times were comparable. While it appears that the shorter job first scheduler is more beneficial, it would be necessary to understand the purpose of the processes to determine if the priority scheduling provided a better experience for the user. In an instance where the priority schedule benefited the user, such as choosing to prioritive programs on screen vs in the background, it could justify the additional average waiting time.

## Enviornment
